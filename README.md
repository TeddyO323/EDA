## The provided code generates histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data in a dataset using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn. It performs the following tasks:


- Imports necessary libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Reads a CSV file containing data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Divides the columns into two types: numerical and categorical.
- Prints lists of numerical and categorical columns.
- Creates histograms for each numerical column using Seaborn's `sns.histplot()` function.
- Saves the histograms as image files in an 'output' directory.
- Closes each plot after saving to prepare for the next one.
